BUSINESS PITCH :

We, the HIDDEN CODERS extend our warm greetings to the panel of judges. We thank you for giving us your valuable time and giving us an opportunity to present to you our innovative and revolutionary idea that aims to solve certain redundant everyday problems that on first glance don’t look concerning.

We, the HIDDEN CODERS have come up with a business pitch for a website that aims to solve the problems encountered by a regular hostel student in their normal life in the hostel. 

There have been many times, were we wish to book a room cleaning appointment, or book an electrician to fix the AC in the brutal Vellore Summers, but we just don’t have the time or energy to wait for the lift to stop at every other floor before eventually reach the ground floor, or maybe our favourite team is playing a very crucial game that just keeps us glued to the edge of our seats. Moreover, it becomes a hassle to maintain a thick and heavy registers for the wardens and the various maintenance in-charges. 
This is where we come in with our innovative ONE STOP SOLUTION , “Hostel Buddy”.

No MORE, will we have to wait for the lift to take us to the ground floor just to mention that we need room cleaning. Loving the game on TV? Too lazy to go downstairs? Slaying those chumps on valorant with the BOYS? Or just enjoying a peaceful Sunday afternoon, book all your room cleaning and servicing appointments with just 3 simple clicks.

Hostel Buddy is an interactive site that allows users to log-in, and book their required services with few simple clicks, completely HASSLE-FREE.

BENEFITS AND UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION:

This site removes the hassle of maintaining pen and paper records.

It’s time to digitalize this frankly outdated system and replace it with something new, something innovative.

SUMMARY AND CALL-TO-ACTION:

From our pitch today, it is evident that we want change, and the ONLY way for change is us and our service, Hostel Buddy.

So, are you guys ready to help us move forward to the next round and become our Hostel Buddies.

IDEA PITCH:

Dear Panelists, thank you for giving us the opportunity to present our proposal in front of you for review 1. We are working on the business plan to initiate our service targeting the male hostelers in the field of daily convenience. For the service to be accessible, our team requires the integration of our service into a larger portfolio such as VTOP. 

The site works using HTML/CSS with bootstrap on the front and python with MySQL in the back. The roadmap of the idea is to provide convenience to the users while booking of services like room cleaning and maintenance.

Looking forward to implementing the idea further in review-2. 
Thanking you for your positive and prompt reply.
